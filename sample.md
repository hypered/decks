# Pandoc and Reveal.js

## Pandoc

- The content of the deck is written in Markdown.
- It is converted to HTML using Pandoc.

## Reveal.js

- Pandoc supports `reveal.js` directly.
- But it can also use a modified template.
- In addition to the template, I also have some small CSS tweaks.

## Image

![A sample image.](/images/waves.jpg "01 - Example image")

## TODO

- Serve the different files from the local Nginx instead of using the Internet.
- `reveal.js` normally supports a `slideNumber` option where the value `'c'`
  should flatten the numbering scheme.
