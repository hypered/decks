# Slide decks

This is a collection of slide decks.

The generated HTML slides are in the `docs/` directory: this repository can use
the GitHub Pages feature from the `master` branch.

This uses a custom Revealjs template that (should) match the design-system
repository.

TODO: the Revealjs template and associated `static/` directory should end up in
the design-system repository. This repository should then only contain the
`.md` files and build scripts.
